Code:

- Create decorators for prototypes.
- Improve error messages for prototypes.
- Write more tests (prototypes, error handling).
- Make a deployment action.
- Make a visualization.
- Do a stress test for performance.
- Allow replications, warm-up time.

Documentation:

- Document the basic theory.
- Document how each of the basic patterns can be implemented (priority queue, ...).
- Note in the documentation that 'mutable types' do not work. Consequently, must use the pn_list, rather than the traditional Python list.
