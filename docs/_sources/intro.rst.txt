SimPN
=====

SimPN (Simulation with Petri Nets) is a package for discrete event simulation in Python.

SimPN provides a simple syntax that is based on Python functions and variables, making it familiar for people who already know Python. At the same time, it uses the power of and flexibility of `Colored Petri Nets (CPN)`_ for simulation. It also provides prototypes for easy modeling of frequently occurring simulation constructs, such as (customer) arrival, processing tasks, queues, choice, parallelism, etc.
