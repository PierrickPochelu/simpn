Example: Repairs Workshop
=========================

Repairs arrive at a rate that is exponentially distributed at an average of 2 per day.

After a repair arrives, it is inspected. This is done by an engineer. The company employs 4 engineers. Inspection takes a time that is uniformly distributed between 0.3 and 0.7 days.

Inspection leads to a list of parts that must be replaced. A purchasing officer subsequently orders the parts from suppliers. The company employs 3 purchasing officers. It takes the purchasing officer a time that is uniformly distributed between 0.3 and 0.7 days to place the orders with the optimal suppliers.

After the purchasing officer has ordered the parts, it takes a time that is uniformly distributed between 0 and 10 days for the parts to arrive. After arrival of the parts, an engineer can do the repair. This takes a time that is uniformly distributed between 0.3 and 0.7 days.

After the item is repaired, tests are performed on it by an engineer. This also takes a time that is uniformly distributed between 0.3 and 0.7 days.
