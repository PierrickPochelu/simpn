Simulation with Petri Nets
==========================

Provides a package for discrete event simulation in Python using the theory of `Colored Petri Nets (CPN)`_.

The package facilitates the creation of simulation models using Python code. In this way learning CPN is relatively easy for people who already know Python. At the same time, the power of CPN is behind the simulation model, which allows for much flexibility.

The package also provides prototypes for easy modeling of frequently occurring simulation constructs, such as (customer) arrival, processing tasks, queues, choice, parallelism, etc.
